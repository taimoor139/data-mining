Given the 256 gray levels available in a normal monitor (and the similarly limited human ability to detect differences in gray values), numerically mapping the data values into the visible range is not going to work well.  But given that we are already backing off from a direct numerical mapping in the above approaches for correcting undersaturation and for doing log transformations, what if we entirely abandon the numerical mapping approach, using the numbers only to form a partial ordering of the data values?  Such an approach would be a rank-order plot, preserving order and not magnitudes.  For 100 gray values, you can think of it as a percentile-based plot, with the lowest 1% of the data values mapping to the first visible gray value, the next 1% mapping to the next visible gray value, and so on to the top 1% of the data values mapping to the gray value 255 (black in this case).

    "The steps above show how to avoid the six main plotting pitfalls by hand, but it can be awkward and relatively slow to do so.  Luckily there is a new Python library available to automate and optimize these steps, named [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader).  Datashader avoids users having to make dataset-dependent decisions and parameter settings when visualizing a new dataset.  Datashader makes it practical to create accurate visualizations of datasets too large to understand directly, up to a billion points on a normal laptop and larger datasets on a compute cluster.  As a simple teaser, the above steps can be expressed very concisely using the Datashader interface provided by [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org):"

These taxis operate through a taxi dispatch central, using mobile data terminals installed in the vehicles. Each ride were categorized into three categories: A) taxi central based, B) stand-based or C) non-taxi central based. For the first, an anonymized id is provided, when such information is available from the telephone call. The last two categories refer to services that were demanded directly to the taxi drivers on a B) taxi stand or on a C) random street.
